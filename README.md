# Machine-Learning---internship
Internship Project conducted at the University of Milan - Date of Completion: February/May 2022

The objective of this work is to develop a binary classifier that, by analyzing videos from the UBFC-Phys dataset (https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/ubfc-phys-2), distinguishes whether the subject in a video is experiencing a situation of stress or non-stress. For each phase of the work, specific Machine Learning algorithms were chosen, in particular: MTCNN for face detection, three different convolutional neural networks for feature extraction (VGG-Face, MobileNet, and i3D), and for classification, the Support Vector Machine model, utilizing two of its kernel functions (linear and Radial Basis Function).
